This design was created originally for an e-commerce system, but it never got used. Anyway, I rather not put it to waste because I know someone out there will probably want to use it.

While I can not 'support' technical issues with this design, if you need a small bit of help or have a query, you can contact me through the contact form on my site, http://virtualfunction.net/. I will do my best to try and answer everyone's queries (provided they aren't too time consuming), but I can't guarantee I can do this. Likewise you can email me at jase -[at]- virtualfunction.net

Thank you for downloading my design!
